## Overview

The **MusicPlayer** is a simple yet functional web-based music player that allows users to play, pause, and navigate between different songs. The player includes controls for playing, pausing, skipping to the next track, and going back to the previous one. Additionally, it provides a slider to control the current time of the track.

This project was developed as a portfolio sample to showcase basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills, as well as CSS animations.
